	I use ebay a lot and I was getting really furstrated with how they force item from all over the word in my search results, items that I will end up filtering every single time. As ebay has no intention of giving the user the option to set their location defaults, I wrote a very basic version of this for myself to begin with, now that I see how useful it has been for me and how much time it has saved me, I decided to polish it a bit and share it with the world so that it might help another ebay adict out there :P
