	I use eBay a lot and I was getting really furstrated with how they force items from all over the word in my search results, items that I will end up filtering every single time. As eBay has no intention of providing the users with an option to set their location defaults, I wrote a very basic version of this for myself to begin with, now that I have seen how useful it has been for me and how much time it has saved me, I decided to polish it a bit and share it with the world so that it might help another eBay adict out there :P
